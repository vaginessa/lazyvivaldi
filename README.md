This micro pico nano zepto script will help the laziest to keep their music tidy in their Android phones.

I've been a user of CyanogenMod for some time, and I always had some problems with music.
No, it's not that I don't like the songs I download myself, it's just that they always appeared in my 'Downloads' folder
-as logical-, and my music player couldn't read any song unless they were in the 'Music' folder. Fed up, I spent some secs in
writing this script.

Someone could say 'Hey, vlaze! Why couldn't you just change the default Download destination? You're such a n00b!'

I wanted to make it nerdy stylish; scripting master race m8.
